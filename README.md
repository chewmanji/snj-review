It's 1 000 001. gym tracker on the market, however it's mine and it's FREE.ðŸ˜†  
I have huge passion for working out and that's why I've decided to create the app on my rules.  
The purpose of the project is to have fun, learn new stuff (webdev, devops) and for my own satisfaction. :blush:

## Features :fire:

- Creating a workout session
- Adding exercises to a workout session
- Adding sets to workout exercises
- Displaying exercises to choose from based on the user's latest ones
- Displaying available exercises with option to see details
- Evidence of completed workouts
- Charts of results for a specified exercise over time
- Authentication, authorization (based on JWTs)

### Future :rocket:

The app has a lot of potential for development.  
However for the nearest future I plan to refactor code (it's really shitty xd),  
add more data in dashboard home view, do something useful with user's email (e.g weekly summaries of workouts),  
add some testing :grimacing: and logging :sob:.
